Library:
- [ ] Finish implementing all elements
  - [x] phase-shifter
  - [ ] EO Modulator
  - [ ] LFSR
  - [ ] PWL source
- [ ] Add models for the pcm
  - [ ] Sequential FDTD/HEAT/...
  - [ ] Looped MATLAB model
  - [x] Raphael's LUT model
- [ ] Rework the photodetector device into:
  - [x] Single-ended photodetector (with noise)
  - [ ] Opticall2 type photodetector
  - [x] Oscilloscope probe
- [ ] Add a monitor device to keep track of simulation duration
  - [x] Time
  - [ ] Energy spent by sources
  - [ ] Energy left within circuit

Netlist:
- [ ] Finish parser for all elements (and settings)
- [ ] Document (keep up to date list of available components and commands)
- [ ] Implement hierarchy
- [ ] Implement named components

Simulation features:
- [ ] Bundle all simulation parameters (timestep, precision)... into a class which can be used by devices
- [ ] Bundle all material parameters into a table to make it easier to track/replace default parameters ?
- [ ] Make a cmd line switch to run in CW mode
- [x] implement runtime monitoring (energy...)
- [ ] improve signals (use a more general "multidomain signal" class ?)
- [ ] handle multiple propagation modes
- [ ] handle bidirectionality in devices
- [ ] handle arbitrary waveforms
- [ ] handle non-linear effects
- [ ] handle GVD as well

Utilities:
- [ ] Implement frequency sweeps (depends on CW availability for transmission)
- [ ] Improve plotting capabilities
  - [x] GTKWave
  - [ ] Python reading with pyDigitalWaveTools
- [ ] Link with a GUI for creating the circuits
  - [ ] xschem

Other:
- [ ] Write data into a db (e.g. hdf5) instead of within the file-system
- [ ] Logging features
- [ ] Refactor once design is established
- [ ] Implement a parallel job manager
- [ ] Make some more features available through the command line
- [ ] Readme and documentation
